//Instructions on how to play the game

Launch the game and follow those steps:

0)At the start of the game you will be asked if you want to load your previous game. 
If yes enter 1 otherwise enter 0 and start a new game.

1)Enter the number of players and their names, it's pretty straight forward.

2)At every round specify if you want to exit&save (1) or resume (0).

3)For every player the table is displayed, the name of the player, his secret animal and your hand from which you choose the card you want to play.
To do so enter one of the indexes above the cards and press enter.

4)You will then have the possibility to reverse the chosen card. Enter 1 if you want it reversed (180°), 0 otherwise.

5)Now time to place the card on the board. Look at the table, choose where you want to put it.
Enter the chosen X coordinate. Press enter. Enter the Y coordinate. Press enter. 
If your choice was not permitted, you will have to enter new coordinates.

6)You might need to perform actions if you chose to play an action card.

7)It's the next player's turn and the same goes on. We're back to step 2).
